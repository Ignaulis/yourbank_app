# 💳 YourBank – Multi-Page Bank Website

A responsive, modern **multi-page** banking website for a fictional bank called **YourBank**.  
This project is based on a **Figma design clone**, developed using **React** and **SCSS**, with working **login and registration functionality** using `localStorage`.

## 🎯 Project Overview

YourBank is a visually engaging and responsive banking website. It features multiple pages, reusable components, and basic authentication (login/register) handled locally. The goal was to recreate a clean, component-based UI from Figma and implement user interactions for a realistic prototype.

- **React** – Frontend framework
- **SCSS** – Styling with modular SCSS structure
